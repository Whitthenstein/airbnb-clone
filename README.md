## Overview

[![Project Overview](/public/images/airbnb-clone_overview.jpg)](https://rent-app-project.vercel.app/)

_Live demo can be found [here](https://rent-app-project.vercel.app/)._

This is a project that aims to be a simple clone of the core functionality of the Airbnb website.

User specific features like scheduling trips and manage listings require a login, Therefore the app allows signup and login using email or Google/Github SSO.

Users can see all the listings of properties on the website as well as filter these listings by categories located at the top of the page.

Selecting a listing takes the user to that listing's page to see all the details for it, and lets him schedule a trip, selecting days on the calendar on the right.

Clicking on the <mark> _Airbnb your home_</mark> button logged in users can create a listing for a property. A modal will popup with the necessary prompts the user can fill to be able to create a listing.

I decided to make this project to learn Cloudinary CDN and MongoDB. As well as improving my skills in Typescript, NextJS, React and Tailwind.
